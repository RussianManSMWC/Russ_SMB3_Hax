Message system for SMB3. Messages are displayed in status bar.

Notes:
* Uses PRG expansion from 32 banks to 64
* i didn't test these but it should in theory work with 2P mode and vertical levels
* minor bug - screen glitches for a frame when uploading message (and restoring status bar)
* Search for !MESSAGES tag for modifications in code.

How to insert a sprite into your disassembly:
* Replace table entries for sprite number you want to insert into with ones provided
* Replace code of sprite you're replacing with code provided
* Insert "common" code and tables from "Used routines n tables.asm" somewhere in bank/banks where sprites you're inserting are
* Insert defines from "Used defines.asm" in smb3.asm.
* Be wary of potential space issues - you'll probably want to sacrifice more than one sprite to fit in new custom sprite

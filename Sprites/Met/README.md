Met from Mega Man series. This is a relatively basic enemy. It stays in place untill player comes close, after which it shoots a fireball, then walk a bit, and stop in place, the cycle then repeats. It's immune to fireballs, but can be destroyed by other means.

Graphics and Idea: Sharker Da Shark from Discord.
